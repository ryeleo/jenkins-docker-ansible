# Jenkins Docker Ansible via requirements.txt
A continuous build/deploy solution that installs ansible via `requirements.txt`. This example runs `ansible-playbook` for a simple "hello world" Ansible `main.yml` file.

> Tip: It is nice to lock/set your project's ansible `version` via `requirements.txt`.
